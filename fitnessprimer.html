									<h1>Fitness Primer</h1>
									<p>Many people have the drive and determination to get into shape, but they lack the knowledge and understanding to do so. Often times people will find themselves overloaded with conflicting information which will make them hesitant to start or simply confused on how to properly go about reaching their goals. On this page I will answer some of the most common questions and clear up some of the most common misconceptions regarding fitness. Reading through this page should give you the knowledge required to understand how the majority of fitness goals are achieved and how the basics of getting into shape works.</p>

										<dt id="wutrcals">Q: What are calories and how do they relate to body weight and fitness?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Calories are what food is made of. There are three types of calories: Protein, Fats and Carbohydrates, which are called macronutrients. All foods that contain calories are made up of different ratios of these 3 types of macronutrients. 1 gram of both protein and carbs provide 4 calories, while 1 gram of fats provide 9 calories.</p>

											<p>Caloric intake is directly related to body weight and body weight changes. Each person burns a certain amount of calories per day, which we refer to as "maintenance calories". In other words, if a person were to eat their maintenance calories every single day, they would stay the same weight. If a person consistently eats MORE calories than this number they will gain weight, and on the contrary if they consistently eat LESS than this number they will lose weight. This is how gainig and losing weight works. It is NOT about the foods you choose to eat, but it is directly related to HOW MUCH you eat. Remember, HOW MUCH you eat, NOT WHAT you eat is what determines bodyweight changes.</p>

											<p>One pound of fat equals approximately 3500 calories. That being said, if a person wanted to lose one pound per week, they should eat 500 calories BELOW their maintenance calories every day (500*7 = 3500) which will result in a caloric deficit of 3500 calories by the end of the week. On the other hand, if a person wanted to gain one pound a week, they should eat 500 calories ABOVE their maintenance calories.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt id="mymaint">Q: How do I find my maintenance calories?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: To find your maintenance calories you can use an online calculator like this one, and then test it's accuracy for a couple of weeks. All that is needed to test is basic math skills and consistency. The first step is to make sure you weigh yourself once a week at the same time of day and under the same conditions. Then you would eat the same amount of calories every single day for a week, and at the end of the week weigh yourself again and note any changes in bodyweight (this may take multiple weeks to get a more accurate result since bodyweight sometimes fluctuates naturally).</p>

											<p>Remembering that it takes about +/- 500 calories daily for a week straight in order to lose or gain a pound, you can take the difference in bodyweight from the beginning of the week and the end of the week and calculate how many calories above or below maintenance you've been eating. If you were eating 2000 calories daily and you lost a pound at the end of the week, then you know the calories you're eating are roughly 500 below your maintenance calories, which puts your maintenance at roughly 2500 calories.</p>

											<p>Remember, it's not important to be EXACT; as long as you're estimating closely and being consistent, you will make progress.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt id="howtobuild">How do I build muscle?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: You build muscle by resistance training (surprise!) and eating in a caloric surplus. When you perform resistance training you create damage to your muscles in the form of micro-tears; when resting after a bout of resistance training, your body repairs those micro-tears resulting in a bigger and stronger muscle. This is why rest is so important and as a general rule you should not work a muscle two consecutive days in a row (rare exceptions exist for a few advanced programs). Muscles grow when you are resting and allowing them to recover, NOT during exercise. In order to continue building muscle you must constantly overload your muscle with more and more stimulus; this can be in the form of adding resistance to an exercise, performing more repetitions or sets or some other method of progression. If you continue to perform the same amount of resistance for the same amount of reps and sets, your body will eventually stop building muscle as it is already adapted the stimulus.</p>

											<p>The reason you need to be in a caloric surplus to build muscle is because building muscle is difficult process for the body, and thus any muscle built while not eating in a surplus is minimal to non-existent (again, exceptions exist such as beginners who are in their first 3 months or so of lifting, but generally this holds true for everyone else). This is why diet is key and if you are struggling to build muscle, you need to make sure that you are gaining weight and making progress in your training.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt id="howtolose">How do I lose weight?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: You lose weight by eating less calories than your body burns in a day. If your body burns 2,000 calories and you consume only 1,500 calories, your body will turn to it's fat stores for the extra 500 calories that it needs when it runs out of food to use for energy. Fat loss is not based on what type of foods you eat or even how much exercise you do, it is a product of being in a caloric deficit (eating less than your body burns). It doesn't matter whether you eat "clean" or "dirty" foods, what matters is how much you eat. If person A and person B both burn 2,000 calories per day, and person A eats 1,500 calories of junk food while person B eats 2,000 calories of healthy food, person A will lose weight while person B will not.</p>

											<p>There are two ways of creating a caloric deficit, the first is to reduce caloric intake, and the second is to burn more calories. Generally speaking you want to create a caloric deficit by first eating less and then adding exercise if you want to speed up progress. The reason eating less should be your priority is because an exercise only approach will not burn enough calories to create a big enough deficit to make optimal fat loss progress. It is much easier to eat 300 less calories than it is to burn an additional 300 calories on a consistent basis. <u>It is entirely possible to lose body fat while doing zero cardio</u>.</p>
										</dd>


										<dt id="activelose">I'm a very active person and I'm always on my feet, why can't I lose weight?</dt>
										<dd>
											A: Because you are not eating less calories than your body burns in a day. No matter how active you are or how many times a week you exercise, you will not lose weight if you are not consuming less calories than your body burns every day. Therefore you need to do one of three things; reduce caloric intake until you are in a deficit, increase activity, or the preferred method of doing both. Diet is the most important aspect of weight loss and you <u>cannot out-train a bad diet</u>. You can walk all day every day but if you consume too many calories you will not lose weight.

										<dt id="bestroutine">Q: What is the best routine that I can do to build muscle or lose fat?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Gaining muscle or losing fat is not dependant on the routine you are on, but depends on your current diet, proper training is only used to assist in the process. There is no one single routine that is the "best", as there are multiple paths to success and it will also vary from person to person. That being said, there are some rules that a routine should follow in order to produce optimal results. Generally speaking, a good routine will focus on big compound movements while also performing enough accessory work on the side, and it will include multiple rep ranges in order to strike a balance between intensity and volume.</p>

											<p>Generally speaking, you do NOT want to create your own routine if you are not already an advanced lifter with years of lifting under his/her belt. There are plenty of free routines out there right now that have been proven to work. For a beginner I recommend a strength focused full body routine and for intermediate to advanced anything from a full body routine to an upper/lower split or even a push/pull/legs split can work.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt id="toningreps">Q: Is it true that to tone a muscle you should train in the higher rep ranges?</dt>
										<dd>
											A: This is a misconception as there is no such thing as making a muscle more "toned" by training it in a certain rep range. When someone refers to a muscle being "toned", what they are really talking about is a muscle that simply has very little body fat covering it and can thus be seen in detail. To get this effect you have to reduce overall body fat by eating in a caloric deficit. It has virtually nothing to do with the rep range you train in.
										</dd>

										<dt id="repranges">Is it true that low reps are better for strength and high reps are better for hypertrophy?</dt>
										<dd>
											A: This is a common misconception that has been held as truth for many years; only recently has research come out to show that this is simply not the case. While strength and muscular endurance ARE tied to rep range, hypertrophy is not. When controlling for total amount of hard sets ("hard set" being defined as a set taken to 2-3 reps of failure), all rep ranges will produce comparable amounts of hypertrophy. So 4 sets of 8 will cause the same amount of muscle growth as 4 sets of 12 if both are taken close to failure. What you want to do is choose a rep range that you personally feel allows you to get enough quality sets and produce enough quality volume per week. How much volume you should be doing is an entirely separate discussion. Just note that rep range is not important for hypertrophy.

										<dt id="howtolose">Q: What kind of food should I eat to lose vs gain weight?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Gaining or losing weight is not a result of WHAT you eat, but HOW MUCH you eat. Weight loss, for example, is done by eating less calories than your body burns in a day. By doing this, once your body burns through the food that you eat and it still needs energy to function, it will turn to itself and burn stored fat as energy to make up the difference. In regards to weight gain/loss, the only thing that matters is total caloric intake. This means that you do not need to suffer by force feeding yourself salads or other foods that you may dislike, as it will have no affect on progress as long as you follow your macronutrient and calorie guidelines.</p>
