										<dt id="wutrcals">Q: What are calories and how do they relate to body weight and fitness?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Calories are what food is made of. There are three types of calories: Protein, Fats and Carbohydrates. All foods that contain calories are made up of different ratios of these 3 types of calories. 1 gram of both protein and carbs provide 4 calories, while 1 gram of fats provide 9 calories.</p>

											<p>Caloric intake is directly related to body weight and body weight changes. Each person burns a certain amount of calories per day, which we refer to as "maintenance calories". In other words, if a person were to eat their maintenance calories every single day, they would stay the same weight. If a person consistently eats MORE calories than this number they will gain weight, and on the contrary if they consistently eat LESS than this number they will lose weight. This is how gainig and losing weight works. It is NOT about the foods you choose to eat, but it is directly related to HOW MUCH you eat. Remember, HOW MUCH you eat, NOT WHAT you eat is what determines bodyweight changes.</p>

											<p>One pound of fat equals approximately 3500 calories. That being said, if a person wanted to lose one pound per week, they should eat 500 calories BELOW their maintenance calories every day (500*7 = 3500) which will result in a caloric deficit of 3500 calories by the end of the week. On the other hand, if a person wanted to gain one pound a week, they should eat 500 calories ABOVE their maintenance calories.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt id="mymaint">Q: How do I find my maintenance calories?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: To find your maintenance calories you can use an online calculator like this one, and then test it for a couple of weeks. All that is needed to test is basic math skills and consistency. The first step is to make sure you weigh yourself once a week at the same time of day and under the same conditions. Then you would eat the same amount of calories every single day for a week, and at the end of the week weigh yourself again and note any changes in bodyweight (this may take multiple weeks to get more a more accurate result since bodyweight sometimes fluctuates a bit).</p>

											<p>Remembering that it takes about +/- 500 calories daily for a week straight in order to lose or gain a pound, you can take the difference in bodyweight from the beginning of the week and the end of the week and calculate how many calories above or below maintenance you've been eating. If you were eating 2000 calories daily and you lost a pound at the end of the week, then you know the calories you're eating are roughly 500 below your maintenance calories, which puts your maintenance at roughly 2500 calories.</p>

											<p>Remember, it's not important to be EXACT; as long as you're estimating closely and being consistent, you will make progress.</p>

										<dt id="bestroutine">Q: What is the best routine that I can do to build muscle or lose fat?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Whether you gain muscle or lose fat is not a factor of the routine you are on, but depends on your current diet. Also, there is no one single routine that is the "best", as there are multiple paths to success and will also vary from person to person. That being said, there are some rules that a routine should follow in order to produce optimal results. Generally speaking, a good routine will focus on big compound movements while also performing enough accessory work on the side, and it will also include multiple rep ranges in order to strike a balance between intensity and volume.</p>

											<p>Generally speaking, you do NOT want to create your own routine if you are not already an advanced lifter with years of lifting under his/her belt. There are plenty of free routines out there right now that have been proven to work. For a beginner I recommend a strength focused full body routine and for intermediate to advanced anything from a full body routine to an upper/lower split or even a push/pull/legs split can work.</p>
