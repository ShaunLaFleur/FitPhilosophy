									<h1>Free Novice Program</h1>
									<p>This is my free full body novice program that is designed to produce great strength and muscle gains. Regardless of your sex or age, as long as you are a novice to weight lifting you will benefit greatly from following this program. It's designed to be straightforward and easy to understand and follow; you have two workouts that you rotate on 3 non-consecutive days of the week, then you take two rest days and repeat the process the next week starting where you left off.</p>

										<h2>Q&A Guide</h2>
									</header>

									<dl>
										<dt>Q: In what order do I perform these workouts and on which days?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: These workouts are performed on 3 non-consecutive days of the week and are rotated. For example, the first week you would workout Monday, Wednesday and Friday by performing the workouts in this order: Workout A (Monday), Workout B (Wednesday), Workout A (Friday), and then taking two days off for rest. You would then begin the next Monday with Workout B since the last workout performed was Workout A on the previous Friday. This means that some weeks you will perform Workout A twice and on others you will perform Workout B twice. So the first week is ABA and the second would be BAB.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: How do I know when to increase or reduce weight?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: If you hit the sets and reps prescribed without a large amount of strain (meaning no grinding reps) you will add 5 pounds next workout, if it is deadlift or squat you can attempt to add 10 pounds instead. If for two consecutive weeks you miss more total reps than the amount of sets for that set and rep scheme (for example, for 5x5 if you miss more than 5 total reps or for 3x8 if you miss more than 3 total reps), lower the weight by 5 pounds.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: Why are hyperextensions and face pulls in this routine? Shouldn't beginners avoid too many additional accessory lifts?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: The lower back and shoulders are arguably the most common areas that weight lifters injure, so as a "prehab", I like to have beginners really strengthen their lower back and rear deltoids to prevent any injuries in the future when they are lifting much heavier loads. By isolating and strengthening the lower back, we strengthen the weakest link in the chain when performing deadlifts and squats, and by isolating the rear deltoids we are strengthening an often neglected head of the shoulder to prevent any shoulder imbalances which can lead to injury.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: Why does the routine have me doing floor presses and box squats instead of regular bench press and squats on some days?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: For multiple reasons. First, the floor press and box squat are much less taxing on the body and easier to recover from, so rotating them in keeps you feeling fresh and gives your body somewhat of a break from constantly hammering away at the same movements. Second, they have great carry over to their conventional counter-parts; by breaking up the eccentric and concentric portion of the lifts, they force you to learn how to be more explosive.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: Why am I doing isolation exercises for the triceps and biceps one day but not on the other?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Workout B does not contain tricep isolations because you are doing double the pressing of Workout A (Overhead Press and Floor Press) and thus it is not needed. It also does not contain bicep isolations because weighted chinups hit the biceps very hard as well. Since they are not necessary on this day, I choose to ommit them so the workout does not become unnecessarily long.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: Why only one heavy set of deadlifts?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Deadlifts are very taxing on your CNS and doing anymore than this for prolonged periods of time can actually cause your strength to regress from an inability to properly recover. The lower back is especially susceptible to injury or recovery issues when deadlifing too heavy too often.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: I can't deadlift without lower back pain/discomfort, what should I do?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Depending on your anthropometry, some people may never be able to deadlift with a conventional stance without discomfort. If this is you, you can replace deadlifts with sumo deadlifts or trap bar deadlifts.</p>
