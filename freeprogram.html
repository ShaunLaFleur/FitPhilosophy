									<h1>Free Novice Program</h1>
									<p>This is my free full body novice program that is designed to be easy to follow and produce rapid changes to your physique. This is a general strength program, and regardless of your age or sex it is a  great routine if you want to build muscle, lose fat and get stronger. The routine is very straightforward and easy to understand; you have two workouts that you rotate on 3 non-consecutive days of the week, then you take two rest days before repeating the process again starting where you left off.</p>

										<h2>Q&A Guide</h2>
									</header>

									<dl>
										<dt>Q: Who is this program geared towards?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Anyone who is new to weight lifting or coming back from a long lay off who wants to improve their physique and health. This is a general strength program that will work for those of all ages and sexes. It is a great program whether you want to gain muscle mass or lose weight to lean down.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: In what order do I perform these workouts and on which days?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: These workouts are performed on 3 non-consecutive days of the week and are rotated. For example, the first week you could workout Monday, Wednesday and Friday by performing the workouts in this order: Workout A (Monday), Workout B (Wednesday), Workout A (Friday), and then taking two days off for rest. You would then begin the next Monday with Workout B since the last workout performed was Workout A on the previous Friday. This means that some weeks you will perform Workout A twice and on others you will perform Workout B twice; week one would be ABA and week two would be BAB.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: What diet should I follow while on this routine?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: That depends on your goals. Either way you go, you want to make sure you eat enough protein in order to recover between workouts. As a general rule of thumb, you want to eat .8 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight, but anything over 200 grams is unnecessary in my opinion.</p>

											<p>If you want to gain muscle, you want to eat in a caloric surplus. A good general recommendation for a novice is to eat enough to gain 1 pound of weight per week, which is about 500 calories over your maintenance calories. If you want to lose weight, you want to do the opposite and eat in a caloric deficit and aim to lose 1-2 pounds per week or 500-1000 calories below maintenance. For more information on dieting you can go <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_diet_details">here</a>.
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: How do I know how much weight to use for each exercise?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: You want to pick a weight that allows you to complete the prescribed sets and reps without too much difficulty. For example if you are struggling to finish 5 reps on your first set for a 5x5 set and rep scheme, you are using too much weight. On the contrary, if you complete your 5th set and could have still done a few more reps, you need to increase the load.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: How do I know when to increase or reduce weight?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: If you hit the sets and reps prescribed without a large amount of strain (meaning no struggling to complete a rep) you will add 5 pounds next workout, if it is deadlift or squat you can attempt to add 10 pounds instead. If for two consecutive weeks you miss more total reps than the amount of sets for that set and rep scheme (for example, for 5x5 if you miss more than 5 total reps or for 3x8 if you miss more than 3 total reps), lower the weight by 5 pounds.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: How long do I need to rest between sets?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Rest time is not important as long as you feel ready for the next set. That being said, a general guideline would be 1-3 minutes between each set. I wouldn't rest longer than 3 minutes because this will cause the workout to be unnecessarily long.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: I can't do 8 bodyweight chin ups, so what do I replace weighted chin ups with?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: If you can't do at least 8 bodyweight chinups, here is how I want you to program your chin ups: Do 3 sets of as many as you can and if you get less than 8 total bodyweight repetitions you will finish the set with chinup negatives until you reach 8 repetitions. So for example, if you do a set of 5 chinups you would then immediately do 3 negatives to reach a total of 8 repetitions. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx740NIKX94">Here is a video explaining what a chinup negative is and how to perform them</a>.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: Why mostly 5x5? Why not more volume?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Beginners do not need a ton of volume in order to grow, but they do have great potential for rapid strength growth. Progressively overloading the muscles with heavier weights is the best way to build muscle, and 5x5 is one of the best balances of intensity and volume for a beginner. It allows you to make fast strength progress because you are working in the lower rep range, while also giving you enough volume to practice technique and form and build muscle.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: Why are hyperextensions and rear delt flyes in this routine? What are their purpose?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: The lower back and shoulders are arguably the most common areas that weight lifters injure, so as a "prehab", I like to have beginners really strengthen their lower back and rear deltoids to prevent any injuries in the future when they are lifting much heavier loads. By isolating and strengthening the lower back, we strengthen the weakest link in the chain when performing deadlifts and squats, and by isolating the rear deltoids we are strengthening an often neglected head of the shoulder to prevent any shoulder imbalances which can lead to injury.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: Why does the routine have me doing floor presses and box squats instead of regular bench press and squats on some days?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: For multiple reasons. First, the floor press and box squat are much less taxing on the body and easier to recover from, so rotating them in keeps you feeling fresh and gives your body somewhat of a break from constantly hammering away at the same movements. Second, they have great carry over to their conventional counter-parts; by breaking up the eccentric and concentric portion of the lifts, they force you to learn how to be more explosive which in turn makes you stronger in the long run. So by rotating exercises we prevent under recovery, avoid the routine getting stale and boring and still progress on the conventional lifts by using exercises that have great carry over.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: Why am I doing isolation exercises for the triceps and biceps on Workout A but not on Workout B?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Workout B does not contain tricep isolations because you are doing double the pressing of Workout A (10 total sets on Workout B versus only 5 for Workout A) and thus it is not needed. It also does not contain bicep isolations because weighted chinups hit the biceps very hard as well. Since they are not necessary on this day, I choose to ommit them so the workout does not become unnecessarily long.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: Why only one heavy set of deadlifts?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: Deadlifts are very taxing on your central nervous system and doing anymore than this for prolonged periods of time can actually cause your strength to regress from an inability to properly recover. The lower back is especially susceptible to injury and recovery issues when deadlifing too heavy too often.</p>
										</dd>

										<dt>Q: I can't deadlift without lower back pain/discomfort, what should I do?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>A: First, see a doctor. Second, depending on your anthropometry, some people may never be able to deadlift with a conventional stance without discomfort. If this is you (and you've tried everything), you can replace deadlifts with sumo deadlifts or trap bar deadlifts.</p>

										<dt>Q: Can I do cardio with this routine?</dt>
										<dd>
											<p>Absolutely. While not a requirement to build the body you want, it is a great assistant to speed up progress and keep your body healthy. However there are some guidelines I would suggest you follow before doing cardio while also following a resistance training routine. These are as followed:</p>

											<ul>
												<li>Do not perform more than 2 HIIT sessions per week. HIIT cardio is much more taxing on the body than traditional steady state cardio and can therefore hinder recovery between resistance training days. This can cause you to stall or make sub par strength progress. Keep HIIT trainig to a minimum of 2 days per week.</li>
												<li>Do not perform cardio before resistance training unless it is separated by at least 2-3 hours (5 minute warmups are fine). It is better to perform cardio either AFTER resistance training or separate the two by a couple of hours or so in order to prevent the cardio from hindering your performance.</li>
											</ul>
