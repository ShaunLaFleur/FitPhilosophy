									<h2><a href="#">Training Philosophy</a></h2>
									<p>For the majority of the population who want to get into shape and become healthier, a well structured resistance training routine is the most optimal path to success. It doesn’t matter if you’re young or old, male or female, it works for everyone and is extremely safe and healthy. Many people are intimidated by resistance training and opt to only stick to cardio, but studies have not only shown that resistance training is superior to a cardio only approach for improving body composition, but it has also been shown to have health benefits to people of all ages, even the elderly. <br /><br />

									In order to improve the way you look and feel, you want to improve your body composition. Body composition is the ratio of body fat to lean mass that your body consists of and is what determines how you look. Those who have an athletic physique have a body which consists of a better muscle to fat ratio. The most optimal way to improve body composition is to follow a resistance training program and proper dieting protocols. Progressing on a well structured resistance training routine will guarantee that your body’s fat to muscle ratio improves on a consistent basis, giving you that lean look that everyone is after. This is the fastest way to improve your body and health; not only will you feel much healthier, but you’ll look the part too!</p>

									<h2><a href="#">Dieting Philosophy</a></h2>
									<p>No more forcing yourself to eat foods you don't enjoy all in the name of eating “clean”! My approach to dieting utilizes "If It Fits Your Macros" or IIFYM for short. With this approach you are allowed to eat any foods that you want <u>as long as it fits into your daily calorie and macronutrient goals</u>.</p>

									<p>Eating healthy is something that everyone should strive to do, but a huge misconception in the fitness industry is that you must eat ONLY healthy foods in order to change your physique and get into shape, when in truth, weight gain and weight loss is determined by how MUCH you eat, not WHAT you eat. When you understand this, your ability to adhere to a diet becomes infinitely easier and long term success is almost a guarantee!</p>
